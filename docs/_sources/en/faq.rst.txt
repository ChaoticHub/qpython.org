**How to run qpython script from other terminals ?**

-  You could "share to" qpython from 3rd apps.

- You need to root the android device first, then soure the env vars  (Just like the qpython wiki link you mentioned) and execute the /data/data/org.qpython.qpy/bin/python or /data/data/org.qpython.qpy/bin/python-android5 (for android 5 above)

**Support pygame ?**

Even you could import pygame in QPython, but QPython doesn't support pygame now.

We will consider to support it later, please follow us on facebook to get it's progress.
